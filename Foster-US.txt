1. As a music enthusiast, I want a varied soundtrack, so that I am consistently entertained.

2. As a veteran video game player, I want responsive controls, so that I am limited only by my skill
level when attempting difficult challenges.

3. As a college student, I want short periods of continuous gameplay, so that I can play in my spare
time.
